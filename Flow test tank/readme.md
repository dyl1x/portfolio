Flow feild Test tank.

I worked on this project for the mechanical and mechatronic design subject at UTS.
I worked on the Software, firmware and the integration. This project was completed during COVID-19 lockdown, but we managed to deliver a fucntional prototype to our client.
This prototype was nominated for the FEIT prototype exhibition 2021.

Problem Statement  

The study of ocean flow and dynamics have been of great interest over the last few years for scientists and engineers around the world, including UTS researchers. Now more than ever, the rapid development and deployment of Autonomous Surface and Underwater Vehicles, has spearheaded the importance of researching and investigating dynamical processes occurring in the ocean. However, planning and controlling the motion strategies for these complex mechatronic systems is quite challenging as they operate in a time-varying environment. Most existing approaches, such as the application of satellites, surface and at depth sampling methodologies have attempted to study and describe oceanic flows. However, few existing approaches have managed to explicitly account for the surrounding fluid dynamics (Jarvis, 2018). The issue is further reinforced by the fact that existing oceanic flow data sets are either finite-time or of low resolution, which further hinders the ability of studying complex dynamic phenomenon. 

As of now, there is little to no information about the existence of a compact field flow test tank that can validate real life ocean currents that can be utilised within a laboratory setting. 


Project Scope  

The project specification report has been performed as part of the curriculum for 48670 Mechanical and Mechatronic Design in order to investigate the development of an experimental flow field test tank of producing controllable ocean-like currents in a laboratory environment. 

The study of complex oceanic dynamics has far more reaching implications. Biological phenomenon such as plankton dispersion and salinity profiles, physical phenomenon such as tides and currents and lastly environmental disasters such as oil spills will be easily examined and described. It is therefore of utmost importance to develop algorithms to better understand and predict ocean behaviour. To develop such algorithms, they must be validated. The client’s strategy is to use the experimental flow field test tank in a laboratory setting to perform the validation. 

The experimental flow field test tank is a compact mechanism capable of generating complex quasi-2-D flow fields that exhibit double-gyre flows. Mapping the location of LCS in real ocean flows is a very challenging tasks and cannot be computed in real time (Michini et al, 2013). Although, it may be impossible to track the mapping of those locations, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) will allow for the extraction of 2D surface structure velocities and data capable to validate and verify the performance of machine learning algorithms that estimate ocean dynamics within a laboratory setting. The PIV methodology will allow for locating and tracking the trajectories in a chaotic dynamical system for an arbitrary long time (Larkin 2015). 

The focus of this project is the construction and validation of an experimental flow field test tank for a multi-robot real life LCS tracking strategy that is compact capable to be used within a laboratory setting. 

Design Objectives 

Design of a flow field test tank to “simulate” ocean currents and dynamics to encapsulate the motion of water in a dynamic fluid system. The desired tank needs to have several components to make a functioning take system. 

Therefore, to produce this test rig, a set of design objectives are as follows:  
The flow tank must have 12 rotating cylinders driven by motors at variable speeds. 
Circuitry to supply power to the motors. 
HMI to control motors individually (direction and speed). 
Motors need to run at least 20 minutes continuously. 
Must have an overhead camera for data collection.  
Camera must face down with the whole tank in view. The camera platform must be stable as to not interfere with the data collection.  
Must be able to drain water from tank. 
Soft cost limit of $1400. 
Must be compact and portable, to be able to be placed on a lab bench.
