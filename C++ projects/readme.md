This folder contains c++ coding projects completed for subject tasks
I run these on linux and compiled using cmake.

The ROS nodes will need other nodes to be running in order to function properly

a1 - is C++ sensor class which simulates real world sensors

a2 - is a program which controlls a fighter jet which intercepts bogies using a tsp algorythm.

a3 - is a ros node which controls an "assistant robot" which follows the robot controlled by the user in the simulation environment.

Refer the documentations, and help pdfs for more information.
